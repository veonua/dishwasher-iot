## Introduction

Have you ever wished that your appliances were smarter and more convenient to use? That's exactly what I wanted for my Samsung dishwasher, which is a great appliance, but didn't have Wi-Fi capabilities. I wanted to be able to remotely start my dishwasher and have it ready for breakfast without having to calculate when to set the timer. After researching my options, I came across a GitHub project that upgraded a coffee maker using an ESP8266 or ESP32 Wi-Fi chip. And that's how the idea to upgrade my dishwasher was born.

While I had no experience with microcontrollers and soldering, I found that the ESP chip was a simple and powerful solution that could integrate Wi-Fi capabilities into my dishwasher. By placing the chip in the middle of the dishwasher's main unit and control panel, I was able to pass data back and forth, read all the statuses displayed, and send commands as if the user pressed the buttons.

In this article, I will explain how I upgraded my Samsung Series 6 dishwasher with an ESP chip and MQTT. This project was tested on the DW60M6050FW/EU, DW60M6050FS/EU, and DW60M5050FS/FH models, but it can likely be adapted to work with other Samsung dishwasher models.
